# React App Skeleton

The point of this is to create a universal skeleton that can be used throughout various begginer React.js projects.
Something you can just pick up and continue working on it without having to worry about the nonsense setups.
I know there are skeletons out there; but I like my own better.

**Don't hate, I just started on this**

## Project TODO's

- Add prettier and eslint rules; integrate them for awesome standard good looking code.
- Figure out how to generate great SCSS architectures with shared variables, keep it DRY my man
- Figure out best project structure
- Figure out easiest way to generate state managers (like redux)
- Figure out more TODO

## Documentation TODO's

- Stop with the TODO's and actually DO's!
- Add information about React version, Node.js version, how to run, etc
- React App Skeleton really sounds lame.
- There'll be more here.
